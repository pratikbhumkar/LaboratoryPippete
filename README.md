# Laboratory Pipette

#### Laboratory pipette representation for myDNA test.
#### .Net core console based application.

Steps to run:
1. Download the code.
2. Open the folder in your favorite IDE.
3. Open terminal and execute the below commands.
4. cd ./LaboratoryPipette
5. dotnet run


### Assumptions

- The arm will fill the pipette in one single drop/pump. So once dropped status will be full.
